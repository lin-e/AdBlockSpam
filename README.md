# AdBlockSpam
Was messing around with AdBlock detection, made this.

Ignore this; it has no actual purpose, I just decided to add it in because I was bored.

Just copy what's in 'index.html' into your page, and copy in 'adBlockSpam.js'. That's it.

I don't do JavaScript at all, and therefore you shouldn't expect anything but horrible code in this. :)
